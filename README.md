forked from mwheelock/Network-Nevel-Analysis

This is a forked directory for the Network Level Analysis (NLA) Toolbox (Beta version). NLA is an extensible MATLAB-based software package for the analysis of behavioral associations with brain connectivity data. NLA utilizes a statistical approach known variously as 'pathway analysis','over representation analysis' or 'enrichment analysis', which was first used to describe behavioral or clinical associations in genome-wide association studies.
